# tictactoe
This is a tictactoe program that can be played with 0-2 players. There is a bot that you can play against that will always force a tie 
if the other player knows good strategy. If the player leaves openings, the bot will beat them. 

In the dist folder there is an executable for windows machines.

There is currently no diffculties levels for the bot. Next step will be added a GUI.
